            <dd>Took a course on Environmental Law, which introduced me to the SDGs ‘wedding cake’ model, emphasizing environmental protection as the foundation for economic development and human well-being.</dd>
            <dd>Also, taking humanity courses here made me realize I am more interested in learnig the base of how every action in the world works, especially for chemistry where we look deeply into molecular scale.</dd>
            <dd>I also became interested in crochet, which made me curious about how modern clothing is produced—often from oil-based materials or recycled plastics. </dd>
            <dd>This connected to what I learned while working on a farm about food waste.</dd>
            <dd>I discovered that some innovative companies are turning agricultural byproducts like banana leaves and coffee grounds into textiles.</dd>
            <dd>Additionally, researchers are even experimenting with reordering amino acid polymers in animal fur to create sustainable proteins.</dd>

            <dd>Although my parents scolded me for starting work immediately after submitting my college applications, it turned out to be one of the best decisions and most meaningful experiences of my life.</dd>
            <dd>During the application process, I realized I could no longer ignore my curiosity about real-world experiences—I needed to engage with the reality of agriculture, environment, and sustainability I deeply cared about.</dd>
            <dd>My experience is written here. Check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJvinQlHl_WfUEOktuujLkUPjFZkdJNucZoQoDkYkRE/edit?usp=sharing">"Reflecting Sustainable Agriculture as a Beginner Farmer"</a></dd>
